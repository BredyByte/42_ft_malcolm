> This repository contains a "ft_malcolm" project that is part of the École 42 curriculum.

## Overview
ft_malcolm is a 42 École outer core project focused on networking and cybersecurity. The goal is to develop a program in C that performs MAC address spoofing, allowing manipulation of a victim's network traffic by impersonating critical network devices, such as the gateway, within the local network (LAN).

This project provides hands-on experience with Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) of the OSI model and introduces key networking concepts such as: *Host, Node, Packet, Protocol, IP, MAC, LAN, and ARP*. By working on ft_malcolm, students gain practical knowledge of network packet manipulation, enabling them to understand the inner workings of network communication and security.
